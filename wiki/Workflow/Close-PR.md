# Close a PR

Sometimes, after a PR has been created, it is appropriate to abandon a PR.  The reasons for this are many and won't be discussed here.

To abandon a PR, you can close it.  This can be done by navigating to the [ZFS on Linux][zol] project, selecting the *Pull requests* tab, selecting the PR to be closed, and selecting *Close pull request*.
