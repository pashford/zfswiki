# Commit Often

When writing complex code, it is strongly suggested that developers save their changes, and commit those changes to their local repository, on a frequent basis.  In general, this means every hour or two, or when a specific milestone is hit in the development.

In addition, it is suggested that the changes be pushed to your forked Github repository every day.

Details of this process can be found in the [Commit the changes][W-commit] page.
