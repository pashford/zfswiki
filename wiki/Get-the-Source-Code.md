# Get the Source Code

This document goes over the four common ways to get the ZFS source code.  This is required for development and to create custom packages.

* **[Release Tarball](#release-tarball)** - Released and tested
* **[Git Release Branch](#git-release-branch)** - Approved for release
* **[Git Master Branch](#git-master-branch)** - Latest version
* **[Fork ZFS Master Branch][]** - Development

## Release Tarball

The release tarball contains a fully tested and released version of ZFS.Â  This is the preferred source code locations for use in production systems.  If you want to use the official release tarballs, then use the following commands to fetch and prepare the source.

```
$ mkdir zfs-on-linux
$ cd zfs-on-linux
$ wget http://archive.zfsonlinux.org/downloads/zfsonlinux/spl/spl-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ wget http://archive.zfsonlinux.org/downloads/zfsonlinux/zfs/zfs-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf spl-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf zfs-x.y.z.tar.gz
```

As an example, the release tarball for ZFS 0.7.6 would be ```zfs-0.7.6.tar.gz```.

## Git Release Branch

The Git *release* branch contains the currently released version of the software and all updates that have been approved for release since the last release.  When a release is made, a *tag* is added to this branch, everything in it is retested and a tarball is created.  If you need a fix that has been approved for release, this is the preferred source code location.  This branch isn't quite as well tested as the release tarballs, so it is preferred that they be used whenever possible.  If you would like to compile directly from the Git *release* branch, please use the following procedures:

```
$ mkdir zfs-on-linux
$ cd zfs-on-linux
$ git clone https://github.com/zfsonlinux/spl.git
$ git clone https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs.git
$ cd spl
$ git checkout spl-0.7-release
$ ./autogen.sh
$ cd ../zfs
$ git checkout zfs-0.7-release
$ ./autogen.sh
$ cd ..
```

**How does the user know that upstream has changed?**

This is needed to provide the necessary script segment to auto-update.

## Git Master Branch

The Git *master* branch contains the latest version of the software, and will probably contain fixes that, for some reason (usually timing, reliability or completness), weren't included in the released tarball.  This is the source code location and procedure for users who absolutely must have a new patch/feature for their system(s).  This source code location is *not* recommended for production use.  If you would like to use the Git *master* version, you can clone it from Github and prepare the source by using the procedure below.

**WARNING**:  Use of the Git *master* branch could introduce problems (usually reliability, integrity or performance) into your environment.  Please be aware of the risks and test the software thoroughly before you take this path.  If a problem appears, sometimes the only way to keep your data intact is to wait for a release.  In a worst-case scenario, it might not be possible to save your data.

```
$ mkdir zfs-on-linux
$ cd zfs-on-linux
$ git clone https://github.com/zfsonlinux/spl.git
$ git clone https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs.git
$ cd spl
$ ./autogen.sh
$ cd ../zfs
$ ./autogen.sh
$ cd ..
```
