# Overview

## Purpose

The purpose of the ZFS Tuning Guide is to provide the reader with the information necessary to tune their ZFS file-systems for improved performance.

Unlike most tuning guides, this one is intended to be a living document, and be updated as the ZFS file-system is changed.  In addition, it is intended to be updated as we find and/or create improved tools to analyze and tune the file-system.

## Audience

The ZFS Tuning Guide is intended to be read by System Administrators, Storage Administrators, Atorage Architects and Infrastructure Architects.  It is intended to be understood by people performing these tasks.

Much of the information in this guide has been extracted from the ZFS source code.  This extraction process can cause the contents of this document to, at times, be less that clear.  We have done what we believe to have been necessary to resolve these clarity issues.

If the reader encounters a section of this guide that is unclear, please provide as much information as possible to the authors so that they can improve this guide.
